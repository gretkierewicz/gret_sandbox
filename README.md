# gret_sandbox

Project of "map" generator.
Main reason - getting some fun with arrays and visualisation of data. 
But also, getting know how to use multiprocessing, file management and many other.

## Features: 

* [x] **Noise Generator**
    * [x] Basic generation and visualization of noise array
        * [x] Levels for better visualisation of surface topology
    * [x] Controls for noise parameters
        * [ ] Offsetting controls
    * [x] Dynamically controlled additional noise arrays for more complex topologies

* [x] **Gradient**
    * [x] Basic (circle) gradient 
    * [ ] Controls for pattern parameters
    * [ ] Option to choose between circle and square pattern

* [x] **Other**
    * [ ] Generation of additional topology details (biomes, rivers, lakes)
    * [ ] Multiprocessing for multiple array's generation or bigger arrays generation (tests done!)
    * [ ] Saving setup, profiles
    * [ ] Exporting array/maps
