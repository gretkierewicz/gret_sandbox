# gret_sandbox

Project of app with use of numpy, pygame and maybe some generators.

## Features: 

* [x] Generation and visualisation of noise array
* [x] Adding levels for better visualisation of surface topology
* [x] Tests with different libraries for choosing one od the best performance in generation
* [x] Checking Tkinter for building UI (in exchange of Pygame/pgui)
* [x] Pulling out full list of factors for best control of noise generator
* [x] Using multiprocessing for multiple array's generation or bigger arrays (testing_area)
* [ ] Adding layers (many noise arrays) to make more complex surface generation possible
* [ ] Adding additional filters, like gradients
* [ ] Generation of additional topology details (biomes, rivers, lakes)
